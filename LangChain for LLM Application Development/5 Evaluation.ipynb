With a traditional fit that is relaxed through the chest, sleeve, and waist, this pullover is lightweight enough to be worn most months of the year. The cotton blend fabric is super soft and comfortable, making it the perfect casual layer. To make dressing easy, this sweatshirt also features a snap placket and a heritage-inspired Mt. Katahdin logo patch. For care, machine wash and dry. Imported.\\nHuman: Do the Cozy Comfort Pullover Set        have side pockets?\"\n",
